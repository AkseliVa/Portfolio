            <p>
                I am a 24-year old, second-year (at the time of writing) student at Haaga-Helia
                University Of Applied Sciences.
            </p>

            <p>
                My main focus in studies is Fullstack-development, and I hope to pursue a career
                in that field, hopefully in the near future.
            </p>
