      <p>Here you will find some general information about me, my passions and hobbies.</p>
      
      <p>More detailed information about my projects can be found in the 'Projects'-page, and also my contact information in the 'Contact'-page.</p>
      
      <p>The project is still quite new so it is in it's early stages. I am aware that
        there are lots of things to fix and add, but I wanted to have atleast something published
        to make the work of employers easier.

      <p>
        I will try to update this site as often as I can, but currently I have a job that I am working
        while on vacation from school so time is not on my side. (I also started building this
        a bit too late)
      </p>

      <p>
        Hopefully this will be a somewhat ok-ish project atleast by summertime.
