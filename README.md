This is a website portfolio to help employers find information about me easier.

Currently it is in it's beginning stages so there isn't much to see, but I will try to update it as fast as I can.

As of this moment it is only using React as the frontend language, but I have plans to use Java, and more specifically Maven and SpringBoot, to add the backend portion.
